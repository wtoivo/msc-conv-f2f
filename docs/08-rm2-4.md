# RM2 ANOVA

## Pre-class activities

### Background: Intrusive memories

In the lecture we worked through calculating an ANOVA by hand in order to gain a conceptual understanding. However, when you run an ANOVA, typically the computer does all of these calculations for you. In this lab we'll show you how to run a one-factor and factorial ANOVA using the `afex` package and post-hoc tests using a package called `emmeans`. 

In this example we will be using data from experiment 2 of [James, E. L., Bonsall, M. B., Hoppitt, L., Tunbridge, E. M., Geddes, J. R., Milton, A. L., & Holmes, E. A. (2015). Computer game play reduces intrusive memories of experimental trauma via reconsolidation-update mechanisms. Psychological Science, 26, 1201-1215](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526368/).

The abstract for the paper is as follows:

> Memory of a traumatic event becomes consolidated within hours. Intrusive memories can then flash back repeatedly into the mind's eye and cause distress. We investigated whether reconsolidation - the process during which memories become malleable when recalled - can be blocked using a cognitive task and whether such an approach can reduce these unbidden intrusions. We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms. A simple, non-invasive cognitive-task procedure administered after emotional memory has already consolidated (i.e., > 24 hours after exposure to experimental trauma) may prevent the recurrence of intrusive memories of those emotional events.

### Activity 1: Set-up

Do the following.

* Open R Studio and set the working directory to your RM2 Chapter 8 folder. Ensure the environment is clear.    
* Open a new R Markdown document and save it in your working directory. Call the file "Chapter 8 Pre-class".    
* Download the `James Holmes_Expt 2_DATA.csv` file from Moodle and save it in your Chapter 8 folder. Make sure that you do not change the file name at all. * Delete the default R Markdown welcome text and insert a new code chunk that loads `pwr`, `lsr`, `car`, `broom`, `ez`, `emmeans` and `tidyverse` using the `library()` function and loads the data into an object named `dat` using `read_csv()`. If you are working on your own machine you may need to install `afex` and `emmeans` but as always **do not install packages on university machines**.
* Add (hint: mutate) a column to `dat` called `subject`that equals `row_number()` to act as a participant ID which is currently missing from the data set.




### Activity 2: Data wrangling

There are a lot of columns in this data set that we don't need for this analysis and the names of the variable are also long and difficult to work with. 

* Create a new object called `dat2` that just has the three columns we need - use `select` to select the columns `subject`, `Condition`, and  `Days_One_to_Seven_Image_Based_Intrusions_in_Intrusion_Diary`
* Use `rename` to rename `Days_One_to_Seven_Image_Based_Intrusions_in_Intrusion_Diary` to `intrusions`
* See if you can do this all in one pipeline



### Activity 3: Numbers and factors

In addition to the names of the variables being too long, the levels of `Condition` are named 1,2,3,4 which R will think is a number rather than a category. We're going to overwrite the column `Condition` with a column that recodes these numbers as a factor. Copy and paste the code below into your Markdown and then run it.


```r
dat2 <- dat2 %>%
  mutate(Condition = as.factor(Condition))
```

**This is a really important step**. If you forget to recode variables as factors and R treats them as numbers, a lot of things won't work. Trust us, we've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong because we forgot to do this step!

### Activity 4: Create summary statistics

Next we want to calculate some descriptive statistics. We're really interested in the scores from each experimental group rather than overall.

* Create an object called `sum_dat`that contains the mean, standard deviation and standard error for the number of intrusions grouped by `Condition`  
* Use the pipe to achieve this in one pipeline  
* Your table should have four columns, `Condition`, `mean`, `sd`, and `se`.  



<div class='solution'><button> Hint</button>


```
## 
## 
## * Use group_by(some_grouping_variable) %>% summarise(...)
## * standard error = sd/sqrt(n) =  sd/sqrt(length(some_variable_name)
```

</div>




### Activity 5: Visualisation

Now we can visualise the data. In the original paper they use a bar plot, which we will reproduce later but for now let's use a better plot that gives us more information about the data. 

* Create the below violin-boxplot with number of intrusions on the y-axis and condition on the x-axis (see Chapter \@ref(viobox)) 
* Change the labels on the x-axis to something more informative (hint: `scale_x_discrete(labels = c("label names")`)  

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="08-rm2-4_files/figure-html/violin-plot-1.png" alt="Number of intrusions by condition" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:violin-plot)Number of intrusions by condition</p>
</div>

We can see from this plot that there are outliers in each of the groups. This information isn't present in the bar plot, which is why it's not a good idea to use them but we will reproduce it anyway.The below code shows your how to produce the bar plot that is presented in the paper. Try and figure out what each bit of code is doing in the plot (remember to use the help documentation for each function) and see what happens when you change the values for each argument.



```r
ggplot(sum_dat, aes(x = Condition, y = mean, fill = Condition))+
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "bar", show.legend = FALSE)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se), width = 0.25)+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,7), 
                     breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7), 
                     name = "Intrusive-Memory Frequency (Mean for the Week")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("No-task control", "Reactivation plus Tetris", "Tetris only",
                                "Reactivation only"))
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="08-rm2-4_files/figure-html/bar-plot-1.png" alt="Bar plot of instrusions by condition" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:bar-plot)Bar plot of instrusions by condition</p>
</div>

### Activity 6: One-way ANOVA

Now we can run the one-way ANOVA using `aov_ez` from the `afex` package and save it to the object `mod`. As well as running the ANOVA, the `aov_ez` function also conducts a Levene's test for homogeneity of variance so that we can test our final assumption.

`aov_ez()` will likely produce some messages that look like errors, do not worry about these, they are just letting you know what it's done. 

* Copy and paste the below code to run and then view the results of the ANOVA using `anova()`.


```r
mod <- aov_ez(id = "subject", # the column containing the subject IDs
              dv = "intrusions", # the DV 
              between = "Condition", # the between-subject variable
              es = "pes", # sets effect size to partial eta-squared
              type = 3, # this affects how the sum of squares is calculated, set this to 3
              data = dat2)
mod
```

Just like with the t-tests and correlations, we can use `tidy()` to make the output easier to work with.

* Run the below code to transform the output. Don't worry about the warning message, it is just telling you it doesn't know how to automatically rename the columns so it will keep the original names.


```r
mod_output <- (mod$anova_table) %>% tidy()
```

```
## Warning in tidy.anova(.): The following column names in ANOVA output were
## not recognized or transformed: num.Df, den.Df, MSE, ges
```

* `term` = the IV  
* `num.Df` = degrees of freedom effect
* `den.Df` = degrees of freedom residuals
* `MSE` = Mean-squared errors
* `statistic` = F-statistic
* `ges` = effect size  
* `p.value` = p.value

You should refer to the lecture for more information on what each variable means and how it is calculated.

* Is the overall effect of Condition significant? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["Yes"]'> <option></option> <option>Yes</option> <option>No</option></select>
* What is the F-statistics to 2 decimal places? <input class='solveme nospaces' size='4' data-answer='["3.79"]'/>
* According to the rules of thumb, the effect size is <select class='solveme' data-answer='["Large"]'> <option></option> <option>Small</option> <option>Medium</option> <option>Large</option></select>


### Activity 7: Assumption checking

You may be wondering why we haven't yet checked the assumptions. Well, unlike the t-tests and correlations, in order to test the assumptions we need to use the model we created with `aov_ez()`, so we couldn't assess them all until this point. For a one-way independent ANOVA, the assumptions are the same as for a Student's t-test:

1. The DV is interval or ratio data
2. The observations should be independent
3. The residuals should be normally distributed
4. There should be homogeneity of variance between the groups

We know that 1 and 2 are met because of the design of our study. To test 3, as we have done before we can look at the QQ-plot of the residuals and test for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The residuals have been stored as one of the components of `mod`. To access them we specify `mod$aov$residuals`.


```r
qqPlot(mod$aov$residuals)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="08-rm2-4_files/figure-html/fig-qq-1.png" alt="qq-plot for model residuals" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:fig-qq)qq-plot for model residuals</p>
</div>

```r
shapiro.test(mod$aov$residuals)
```

```
## [1] 11 60
## 
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
## 
## data:  mod$aov$residuals
## W = 0.87739, p-value = 4.252e-06
```

There are a few things to note about the assumption test results. First, look at the p-value for the Shapiro-Wilk test - `4.252e-06`. Whenever you see the `e` at the end of a number it means that R is using **scientific notation**. Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers. Because the number after the `e` is negative it means the number should be divided by 10 to the power of six. Put simply, move the decimal place six places to the left and you will get the standard number. When reporting p-values in your results section, you should not use scientific notation, instead you should round to 3 decimal places.

* What is the value of `4.252e-06`? <select class='solveme' data-answer='[".000004252"]'> <option></option> <option>.004252</option> <option>42.52</option> <option>.000004252</option></select>

If you want R to round this for you to make it easier to read, you could use the below code to save it to an object, tidy it and then round the p.value. Just remember that in APA style you should never write "p = 0", instead, you should write "p < .001" (because p will never equal actual zero, it can just be very, very, very small).


```r
shapiro <- shapiro.test(mod$aov$residuals) %>% #run the test
  tidy() %>% # tidy the output
  mutate(p.value = round(p.value, digits = 3)) # overwrite the p-value with one rounded to 3 decimal places
```

The second thing to note is that from both the qq-plot and the Shapiro-Wilk test it is clear that the assumption of normality has not been met. Is this a problem? Well, Field et al. (2009) say that if the sample sizes for each group are equal then ANOVA is robust to violations of both normality and of homogeneity of variance. There's also a good discussion of this [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-017-0918-2) but it is a bit technical. We can check how many participants are in each condition using `count()`:


```r
dat2 %>% count(Condition)
```


 Condition    n  
-----------  ----
     1        18 
     2        18 
     3        18 
     4        18 

Thankfully the sample sizes are equal so we should be OK to proceed with the ANOVA. It is not clear whether normality was checked in the original paper.

For the last assumption, we can test homogeneity of variance with Levene's test and the function `test_levene()` from `afex`. The code for this is very simple, you just need to supply the ANOVA model we created earlier `mod`.


```r
test_levene(mod)
```

```
## Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = center)
##       Df F value  Pr(>F)  
## group  3  2.9551 0.03854 *
##       68                  
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

The results from Levene's test show that the assumption of homogeneity of variance has also not been met. The paper does indicate this might be the case as it specifies that the ANOVAs do not assume equal variance, however, the results of the ANOVA that are reported are identical to our results above where no correction has been made although the post-hoc tests are Welch tests (you can tell this because the degrees of freedom have been adjusted and are not whole numbers).

Whilst all of this might seem very confusing - we imagine you might be wondering what the point of assumption testing is given that it seems to be ignored - we're showing you this for three reasons: 

1. To reassure you that sometimes the data can fail to meet the assumptions and it is still ok to use the test. To put this in statistical terms, many tests are **robust** to mild deviations of normality and unequal variance, particularly with equal sample sizes. 
2. As a critical thinking point, to remind you that just because a piece of research has been published does not mean it is perfect and you should always evaluate whether the methods used are appropriate. 
3. To reinforce the importance of pre-registration where these decisions could be made in advance, and/or open data and code so that analyses can be reproduced exactly to avoid any ambiguity about exactly what was done. In this example, given the equal sample sizes and the difference in variance between the groups isn't too extreme, it looks like it is still  appropriate to use an ANOVA but the decisions and justification for those decisions could have been more transparent.


### Activity 8: Post-hoc tests

For post-hoc comparisons, as mentioned, the paper appears to have computed Welch t-tests but there is no mention of any multiple comparison correction. We could reproduce these results by using `t.test` for each of the contrasts.

For example, to compare condition 1 (the control group) with condition 2 (the reactivation plus tetris group) we could run:


```r
t.test(dat2) %>% filter(Condition == "1") %>% pull(intrusions), dat2 %>% filter(Condition == "2") %>% pull(intrusions))

dat2 %>%
  filter(Condition %in% c("1", "2")) %>%
  droplevels() %>% 
  t.test(intrusions ~ Condition, data = .)
```

<div class="info">
<p>Because <code>Condition</code> has four levels, we can’t just specify <code>intrustion ~ Condition</code> because a t-test compares two groups and it wouldn’t know which of the four to compare so first we have to filter the data and use a new function <code>droplevels()</code>. It’s important to remember that when it comes to R there are two things to consider, the data you can see and the underlying structure of that data. In the above code we use <code>filter()</code> to select only conditions 1 and 2 so that we can compare them. However, that doesn’t change the fact that R “knows” that <code>Condition</code> has four levels - it doesn’t matter if two of those levels don’t have any observations any more, the underlying structure still says there are four groups. <code>droplevels()</code> tells R to remove any unused levels from a factor. Try running the above code but without <code>droplevels()</code> and see what happens.</p>
</div>

However, a quicker and better way of doing this that allows you apply a correction for multiple comparisons easily is to use `emmeans()` which computes all possible pairwise comparison t-tests and applies a correction to the p-value. 

First, we use `emmeans()` to run the comparisons and then we can pull out the contrasts and use `tidy()` to make it easier to work with.

* Run the code below. Which conditions are significantly different from each other? Are any of the comparisons different from the ones reported in the paper now that a correction for multiple comparisons has been applied?


```r
mod_pairwise <-emmeans(mod$aov, pairwise ~ Condition, adjust = "bonferroni")
mod_contrasts <- mod_pairwise$contrasts %>% tidy()
```

<div class="warning">
<p>The inquisitive amongst you may have noticed that <code>mod</code> is a list of 5 and seemingly contains the same thing three times: <code>anova_table</code>, <code>aov</code> and <code>Anova</code>. The reasons behind the differences are too complex to go into detail on this course (see <a href="https://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/d_04.html">here</a> for more info) but the simple version is that <code>anova_table</code> and <code>Anova</code>use one method of calculating the results (type 3 sum of squares) and <code>aov</code> uses a different method (type 1 sum of squares). What’s important for your purposes is that you need to use <code>anova_table</code> to view the overall results (and replicate the results from papers) and <code>aov</code>to run the follow-up tests and to get access to the residuals (or <code>lm()</code> for factorial ANOVA). As always, precision and attention to detail is key.</p>
</div>

### Activity 9: Power and effect size

Finally, we can replicate their power analysis using `pwr.anova.test`.

> On the basis of the effect size of d = 1.14 from Experiment 1, we assumed a large effect size of f = 0.4. A sample size of 18 per condition was required in order to ensure an 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.


```r
pwr.anova.test(k = 4, f = .4, sig.level = .05, power = .8)
```

```
## 
##      Balanced one-way analysis of variance power calculation 
## 
##               k = 4
##               n = 18.04262
##               f = 0.4
##       sig.level = 0.05
##           power = 0.8
## 
## NOTE: n is number in each group
```

We've already got the effect size for the overall ANOVA, however, we should also really calculate Cohen's D using `cohensD` from `lsr` for each of the pairwise comparisons. This code is a little complicated because you need to do it separately for each comparison, bind them all together and then add them to `mod_contrasts` - just make sure your understand which bits of the code you would need to change to run this on different data.


```r
d_1_2 <- cohensD(intrusions ~ Condition, 
                 data = filter(dat2, Condition %in% c(1,2)) %>% 
                   droplevels())

d_1_3 <- cohensD(intrusions ~ Condition, 
                 data = filter(dat2, Condition %in% c(1,3)) %>%
                   droplevels()) 

d_1_4 <- cohensD(intrusions ~ Condition, 
                 data = filter(dat2, Condition %in% c(1,4)) %>%
                   droplevels())

d_2_3 <- cohensD(intrusions ~ Condition, 
                 data = filter(dat2, Condition %in% c(2,3)) %>% 
                   droplevels())

d_2_4 <- cohensD(intrusions ~ Condition, 
                 data = filter(dat2, Condition %in% c(2,4)) %>% 
                   droplevels())

d_3_4 <- cohensD(intrusions ~ Condition, 
                 data = filter(dat2, Condition %in% c(3,4)) %>%
                   droplevels())

pairwise_ds <- c(d_1_2,d_1_3,d_1_4,d_2_3,d_2_4,d_3_4)

mod_contrasts <- mod_contrasts %>%
  mutate(eff_size = pairwise_ds)
```


<div class="warning">
<p>What are your options if the data don’t meet the assumptions and it’s really not appropriate to continue with a regular one-way ANOVA? As always, there are multiple options and it is a judgement call.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You could run a non-parametric test, the Kruskal-Wallis for between-subject designs and the Friedman test for within-subject designs. There is more information about how to do this in Chapter @ref(refsup).</li>
<li>If normality is the problem, you could try transforming the data. Field et al. (2009) has a good section on data transformation.</li>
<li>You could use bootstrapping, which is not something we will cover in this course at all. Again, Field et al. (2009) covers this although it is a little complicated.</li>
</ol>
</div>

### Activity 10: Write-up

The below code replicates the write-up in the paper, although has changed the Welch t-test for the pairwise comparisons.


```r
Second, and critically, for the 7-day diary postintervention, there was a significant difference between groups in overall intrusion frequency in daily life, F(`r mod_output$num.Df`, `r mod_output$den.Df`) = `r mod_output$statistic %>% round(2)`, p = `r mod_output$p.value %>% round(3)`, ηp2 = .`r mod_output$ges %>% round(2)`. Planned comparisons demonstrated that relative to the no-task control group, only those in the reactivation-plus-Tetris group, t(`r mod_contrasts$df[1]`) = `r mod_contrasts$statistic[1] %>% round(2)`, p = `r mod_contrasts$p.value[1] %>% round(2)`, d = `r mod_contrasts$eff_size[1] %>% round(2)`, experienced significantly fewer intrusive memories; this finding replicated Experiment 1. Critically, as predicted by reconsolidation theory, the reactivation-plus-Tetris group had significantly fewer intrusive memories than the Tetris-only group, t(`r mod_contrasts$df[4]`) = `r mod_contrasts$statistic[4] %>% round(2)`, p = `r mod_contrasts$p.value[4] %>% round(2)`, d = `r mod_contrasts$eff_size[4] %>% round(2)`, as well as the reactivation-only group, t(`r mod_contrasts$df[5]`) = `r mod_contrasts$statistic[5] %>% round(2)`, p = `r mod_contrasts$p.value[5] %>% round(2)`, d = `r mod_contrasts$eff_size[5] %>% round(2)`. Further, there were no significant differences between the no-task control group and the reactivation-only group, t(`r mod_contrasts$df[3]`) = `r mod_contrasts$statistic[3] %>% round(2)`, p = `r mod_contrasts$p.value[3] %>% round(2)`, or between the no-task control group and the Tetris-only group, t(`r mod_contrasts$df[2]`) = `r mod_contrasts$statistic[2] %>% round(2)`, p = `r mod_contrasts$p.value[2] %>% round(2)`
```

Second, and critically, for the 7-day diary postintervention, there was a significant difference between groups in overall intrusion frequency in daily life, F(3, 68) = 3.79, p = 0.014, ηp2 = .0.14. Planned comparisons demonstrated that relative to the no-task control group, only those in the reactivation-plus-Tetris group, t(68) = 3.04, p = 0.02, d = 1, experienced significantly fewer intrusive memories; this finding replicated Experiment 1. Critically, as predicted by reconsolidation theory, the reactivation-plus-Tetris group had significantly fewer intrusive memories than the Tetris-only group, t(68) = -1.89, p = 0.38, d = 0.84, as well as the reactivation-only group, t(68) = -2.78, p = 0.04, d = 1.11. Further, there were no significant differences between the no-task control group and the reactivation-only group, t(68) = 0.26, p = 1, or between the no-task control group and the Tetris-only group, t(68) = 1.15, p = 1

## In-class activities

### Factorial ANOVA

For the second part of our ANOVA lab we're going to look at an example of a factorial ANOVA. You'll learn more about interpreting these in the second lecture, but for now, we'll just focus on the code. 

We're going to reproduce the analysis from Experiment 3 of [Zhang, T., Kim, T., Brooks, A. W., Gino, F., & Norton, M. I. (2014). A "present" for the future: The unexpected value of rediscovery. Psychological Science, 25, 1851-1860.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614542274). You may remember this study from the Chapter \@ref(vis) pre-class activity. 

This experiment has a 2 x 2 mixed design:

* The first IV is time (time1, time2) and is within-subjects 
* The second IV is type of event (ordinary vs. extraordinary) and is a between-subjects factor 
* The DV we will use is `interest` 

### Activity 1: Set-up

* Open R Studio and set the working directory to your RM2 Chapter 8 folder. Ensure the environment is clear.    
* Open a new R Markdown document and save it in your working directory. Call the file "Chapter 8 In-class".    
* Download <a href="Zhang et al. 2014 Study 3.csv" download>Zhang et al. 2014 Study 3.csv</a> and save it in your Chapter 8 folder. Make sure that you do not change the file name at all.
* If you are working on your own computer, install the package `rcompanion`. Remember **do not install packages on university computers, they are already installed**.
* Delete the default R Markdown welcome text and insert a new code chunk that loads `pwr`, `rcompanion`, `car`, `broom`, `afex`, `emmeans` and `tidyverse` using the `library()` function.



Run the below code to load the data and wrangle it into the format we need. You don't need to write this code yourself but do make sure you can understand what each line is doing - a good way to do this when the code uses pipes (`%>%`) is to highlight and run each line progressively so you can see how it builds up. Line-by-line the code:

* Reads in the data file
* Select the three columns we need  
* Adds on a column of subject IDs  
* Tidies the data
* Recodes the values of `Condition` from numeric to text labels
* Recodes the values of `time` to be easier to read/write


```r
factorial <- read_csv("Zhang et al. 2014 Study 3.csv")%>%
  select(Condition, T1_Predicted_Interest_Composite, T2_Actual_Interest_Composite)%>%
  mutate(subject = row_number())%>%
  gather(key = time,
         value = interest,
         T1_Predicted_Interest_Composite,T2_Actual_Interest_Composite)%>%
  mutate(Condition = dplyr::recode(Condition, "1" = "Ordinary", "2" = "Extraordinary"))%>%
  mutate(time = dplyr::recode(time, "T1_Predicted_Interest_Composite" = "time1_interest",
                       "T2_Actual_Interest_Composite" = "time2_interest")) %>%
  mutate(Condition = as.factor(Condition))
```

### Activity 2: Descriptive statistics

* Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, ci min and max, SD) for `interest`  for each `Condition` for each `time` (hint: you will need to `group_by()` two variables) and store it in an object named `sum_dat_factorial`. These are known as the cells means.



### Activity 3: Violin-boxplots

We're going to produce two kinds of plots to visualise our data. First, we'll produce violin-boxplots so that we can see the distribution of our data.

* Write the code that produces the below violin-boxplots for the scores in each group. 
  * Hint 1: you will need to add in the second IV in the first call to ggplot as a fill argument (aes(x,y,fill)). 
  * Hint 2: you will need to add `position = position_dodge(.9)` to geom_boxplot to get the plots to align. 

You don't need to replicate the exact colour scheme used below, see if you can play around with the settings to whatever colour scheme you think works best.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="08-rm2-4_files/figure-html/plt1-1.png" alt="Violin-boxplot by condition and time" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:plt1)Violin-boxplot by condition and time</p>
</div>

### Activity 4: Interaction plots

Now we're going to produce an interaction plot that makes it easier to see how the IVs are interacting, which requires some ggplot2 functions we haven't come across yet. Rather than using the raw data in `dat_factorial`, we use the means that we produced in `sum_dat_factorial`. This type of plot requires two geoms, one to draw the points, and one to draw the lines that connect them. 

This plot reproduces the plot used in the paper.

* Run the code and then play around with how it looks by changing the arguments for e.g., colour, line-type, and the theme.


```r
ggplot(sum_dat_factorial, aes(x = time, y = mean, group = Condition, shape = Condition)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = Condition))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Time 1", "Time 2"))+
  theme_classic()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="08-rm2-4_files/figure-html/plot2-1.png" alt="Interaction plot" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:plot2)Interaction plot</p>
</div>

### Activity 5: ANOVA

* Complete the below code to run the factorial ANOVA. Remember that you will need to specify both IVs and that one of them is between-subjects and one of them is within-subjects. Look up the help documentation for `aov_ez` to find out how to do this. 
* Save the ANOVA model to an object called `mod_factorial`
* Use `tidy()` and save the output to an object named `factorial_output`.
* Hint: refer to pre-class Activity 6




```r
mod_factorial <- aov_ez(id = "NULL",
               data = NULL, 
               between = "NULL", 
               within = "NULL",
               dv = "NULL", 
               type = 3,
               es = "NULL") 

factorial_output <- 
```

Look at the results. Remember the pre-class information about how to read p-values in scientific notation.

* Is the main effect of condition significant? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["No"]'> <option></option> <option>Yes</option> <option>No</option></select>
* Is the main effect of time significant? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["Yes"]'> <option></option> <option>Yes</option> <option>No</option></select>
* Is the two-way interaction significant? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["Yes"]'> <option></option> <option>Yes</option> <option>No</option></select>

### Activity 6: Assumption checking

The assumptions for a factorial ANOVA are the same as the one-way ANOVA.

1. The DV is interval or ratio data
2. The observations should be independent
3. The residuals should be normally distributed
4. There should be homogeneity of variance between the groups

As before, we know assumption 2 is met from the design of the study. Assumption 1 throws up an interesting issue which is the problem of ordinal data. Ordinal data is the kind of data that comes from Likert scales and is very, very common in psychology. The problem is that ordinal data isn't interval or ratio data, there's a  fixed number of values it can take (the values of the Likert scale) and you can't claim that the distance between the values is equal (is the difference between strongly agree and agree the same as the difference between agree and neutral?). 

Technically, we shouldn't use an ANOVA to analyse ordinal data - *but almost everyone does*. Most people would argue that if there are multiple Likert scale items that are averaged (which is the case in our study) and this averaged data is normally distributed, then it is not a problem. There is a minority (who are actually correct) that argue you should use non-parametric methods or more complicated tests such as ordinal regression for this type of data. Whichever route you choose, you should understand the data you have and you should be able to justify your decision.

* To test 3, extract the residuals from the model (`mod_factorial$lm$residuals`), create a qq-plot and conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test.

* Are the residuals normally distributed? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["No, but given the sample it is probably acceptable to proceed"]'> <option></option> <option>Yes</option> <option>No</option> <option>No, but given the sample it is probably acceptable to proceed</option></select> 

For the final assumption, we can again use `test_levene()` to test homogeneity of variance.

* Conduct Levene's test. Is assumption 4 met? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["Yes"]'> <option></option> <option>Yes</option> <option>No</option></select>


### Activity 7: Post-hoc tests

Because the interaction is significant, we should follow this up with post-hoc tests using `emmeans()` to determine which comparisons are significant. If the overall interaction is not significant, you should not conduct additional tests.

`emmeans()` requires you to specify the `aov` object, and then the factors you want contrasts for. For an interaction, we use the notation `pairwise ~ IV1 | IV2` and you specify which multiple comparison correction you want to apply. Finally, you can use `tidy()` to tidy up the output of the contrasts and save it into a tibble.

* Run the below code and view the results. 


```r
# run the tests
posthoc_factorial <- emmeans(mod_factorial$aov, 
                             pairwise ~ time| Condition, 
                             adjust = "bonferroni")
# tidy up the output of the tests
contrasts_factorial <- posthoc_factorial$contrasts %>%
  tidy()
```

Note that because there are two factors, we could also reverse the order of the IVs. Above, we get the results contrasting time 1 and time 2 for each condition. Instead, we could look at the difference between ordinary and extraordinary events at each time point.

* Run the below code and look at the output of `contrast_factorial` and `contrasts_factorial2` carefully making sure you understand how to interpret the results. You will find it useful to refer to the interaction plot we made earlier.


```r
posthoc_factorial2 <- emmeans(mod_factorial$aov, 
                             pairwise ~ Condition| time, 
                             adjust = "bonferroni") 

contrasts_factorial2 <- posthoc_factorial2$contrasts %>%
  tidy()
```

Because our main effects (condition and time) only have two levels, we don't need to do any post-hoc tests to determine which conditions differ from each other, however, if one of our factors had three levels then we could use `emmeans()` to calculate the contrast for the main effects, like we did for the one-way ANOVA. 

Finally, to calculate effect size for the pairwise comparisons we again need to do this individually. 

* Run the below code to add on effect sizes to `contrasts_factorial` and `contrasts_factorial2`.


```r
d_extra_t1_t2 <- cohensD(interest ~ time, 
                         data = (filter(factorial, Condition == "Extraordinary") %>% droplevels())) 

d_ord_t1_t2 <- cohensD(interest ~ time, 
                         data = (filter(factorial, Condition == "Ordinary") %>% droplevels())) 


Condition_ds <- c(d_extra_t1_t2, d_ord_t1_t2)

contrasts_factorial <- contrasts_factorial %>%
  mutate(eff_size = Condition_ds)

d_time1_extra_ord <- cohensD(interest ~ Condition, 
                         data = (filter(factorial, time == "time1_interest") %>% droplevels())) 

d_time2_extra_ord <- cohensD(interest ~ Condition, 
                         data = (filter(factorial, time == "time2_interest") %>% droplevels()))


time_ds <- c(d_time1_extra_ord, d_time2_extra_ord)

contrasts_factorial2 <- contrasts_factorial %>%
  mutate(eff_size = time_ds)
```

### Activity 8: Write-up

* p-values of < .001 have been entered manually. There is a way to get R to produce this formatting but it's overly complicated for our purposes. If you want to push yourself, look up the [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) package. 
* The values of partial eta-squared do not match between our analysis and those reported in the paper. I haven't figured out why this is yet - if you know, please get in touch!
* We have replaced the simple effects in the main paper with our pairwise comparisons. 

First we need to calculate descriptives for the main effect of time as we didn't do this earlier.


```r
time_descrip <- factorial %>% 
  group_by(time) %>%
  summarise(mean_interest = mean(interest, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_interest = sd(interest, na.rm = TRUE),
            min = mean(interest) - qnorm(0.975)*sd(interest)/sqrt(n()),
            max = mean(interest) + qnorm(0.975)*sd(interest)/sqrt(n()))
```

Copy and paste the below into **white-space**.


```r
We conducted the same repeated measures ANOVA with interest as the dependent measure and again found a main effect of time, F(`r factorial_output$num.Df[2]`, `r factorial_output$den.Df[2]`) = `r factorial_output$statistic[2] %>% round(2)`, p < .001, ηp2 = `r factorial_output$ges[2] %>% round(3)`; anticipated interest at Time 1 (M = `r time_descrip$mean_interest[1] %>% round(2)`), SD = `r time_descrip$sd_interest[1]%>% round(2)`), 95% CI = [`r time_descrip$min[1]%>% round(2)`, `r time_descrip$max[1]%>% round(2)`]) was lower than actual interest at Time 2 (M = `r time_descrip$mean_interest[2]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r time_descrip$sd_interest[2]%>% round(2)`, 95% CI = [`r time_descrip$min[2]%>% round(2)`, `r time_descrip$max[2]%>% round(2)`]).We also observed an interaction between time and type of experience, F(`r factorial_output$num.Df[3]`, `r factorial_output$den.Df[3]`) = `r factorial_output$statistic[3] %>% round(3)`, p = `r factorial_output$p.value[3] %>% round(2)`, ηp2 = `r factorial_output$ges[3] %>% round(3)`. Pairwise comparisons revealed that for ordinary events, predicted interest at Time 1 (M = `r sum_dat_factorial$mean[3]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r sum_dat_factorial$sd[3]%>% round(2)`, 95% CI = [`r sum_dat_factorial$min[3]%>% round(2)`, `r sum_dat_factorial$max[3]%>% round(2)`]) was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 (M = `r sum_dat_factorial$mean[4]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r sum_dat_factorial$sd[4]%>% round(2)`, 95% CI = [`r sum_dat_factorial$min[4]%>% round(2)`, `r sum_dat_factorial$max[4]%>% round(2)`]), t(`r contrasts_factorial$df[2]%>% round(2)`) = `r contrasts_factorial$statistic[2]%>% round(2)`, p < .001, d = `r contrasts_factorial$eff_size[2]%>% round(2)`. Although predicted interest for extraordinary events at Time 1 (M = `r sum_dat_factorial$mean[1]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r sum_dat_factorial$sd[1]%>% round(2)`, 95% CI = [`r sum_dat_factorial$min[1]%>% round(2)`, `r sum_dat_factorial$max[1]%>% round(2)`]) was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 (M = `r sum_dat_factorial$mean[2]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r sum_dat_factorial$sd[2]%>% round(2)`, 95% CI = [`r sum_dat_factorial$min[2]%>% round(2)`, `r sum_dat_factorial$max[2]%>% round(2)`), t(`r contrasts_factorial$df[1]%>% round(2)`) = `r contrasts_factorial$statistic[1]%>% round(2)`, p < .001, d = `r contrasts_factorial$eff_size[1]%>% round(2)` , the magnitude of underestimation was smaller than for ordinary events.
```

> We conducted the same repeated measures ANOVA with interest as the dependent measure and again found a main effect of time, F(1, 128) = 25.88, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.044; anticipated interest at Time 1 (M = 4.2), SD = 1.12), 95% CI = [4.01, 4.4]) was lower than actual interest at Time 2 (M = 4.69, SD = 1.19, 95% CI = [4.49, 4.9]).We also observed an interaction between time and type of experience, F(1, 128) = 4.445, p = 0.04, ηp2 = 0.008. Pairwise comparisons revealed that for ordinary events, predicted interest at Time 1 (M = 4.04, SD = 1.09, 95% CI = [3.77, 4.31]) was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 (M = 4.73, SD = 1.24, 95% CI = [4.43, 5.04]), t(128) = -5.05, p < .001, d = 0.59. Although predicted interest for extraordinary events at Time 1 (M = 4.36, SD = 1.13, 95% CI = [4.09, 4.64]) was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 (M = 4.65, SD = 1.14, 95% CI = [4.38, 4.93), t(128) = -2.12, p < .001, d = 0.25 , the magnitude of underestimation was smaller than for ordinary events.

### Activity 9: Transforming data

In this chapter we decided that the violation of the assumption of normality was ok so that we could replicate the results in the paper. But what if we weren't happy with this or if the violation had been more extreme? One option to deal with normality is to **transform your data**. If you want more information on this you should consult Chapter \@ref(refsup). 

There are various options for how you can transform data but we're going to use Tukeys Ladder of Powers transformation. This finds the power transformation that makes the data fit the normal distribution as closely as possible with this type of transformation.

* Run the below code. This will use `mutate()` to add a new variable to the data-set, `interest_tukey` which is going to be our transformed DV. The function `transformTukey()` is from the `rcompanion` package. Setting `plotit = TRUE` will automatically create qqPlots and histograms so that we can immediately visualise the new variable. 



```r
factorial <- factorial %>%
  mutate(interest_tukey = transformTukey(interest, plotit=TRUE))
```



Now that you've transformed the DV we can re-run the ANOVA with this new variable.


```r
tukey_factorial <- aov_ez(id = "subject",
               data = factorial, 
               between = "Condition", 
               within = "time",
               dv = "interest_tukey", 
               type = 3)

tukey_factorial
```

Notice that doing this hasn't changed the pattern of the ANOVA results, the p-values for the main effects and interactions are very slightly different but the overall conclusions remain the same. This is likely because the violations of normality was quite mild and there is a large sample size, however, with the transformation we can be more confident in our results and it may not always be the case that the transformed ANOVA is the same if the violations were more extreme. 

#### Finished!

And we're done! There's only one more week of R left. I know that for some of you, you will be breathing a sigh of relief but we really want you to reflect on just how far you've come and the skills that you've learned. Even if you don't continue with quantitative research, your understanding of how data is manipulated and how the final results of journal articles actually happen will have substantially increased and that level of critical awareness is an all-round good skill to have.
