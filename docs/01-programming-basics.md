# Programming Basics

<div class="info">
<p>This chapter is intended to introduce key programming terminology to those students who may have had very little experience with coding, or indeed with computers. As a result of the diverse cohort, even basic practical steps are broken down and supported by screenshots. In my experience, for those with programming anxiety it is very difficult to overcome a bad start to learning R therefore extra effort is paid towards softening the learning curve in these initial labs and providing activities that have a tangible output so that the students can visualise their success.</p>
</div>

In this chapter we will go over some basic programming concepts and terminology, common pitfalls, helpful hints, and where to get help. Those of you who have no programming experience should find this chapter particularly helpful, however, even if you've used R before there may be some helpful hints and tips so please make sure you read through this chapter before Lab 1.

We don't expect you to memorise the information that is contained in this chapter and some sections of it will make more sense when you start writing your own code in Lab 1 - just make sure you know what help is available!

## R and R Studio

For this course, you need two different bits of software, [R]() and [RStudio](). R is a programming language that you will write code in and R Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier. Think of it as knowing English and using a plain text editor like NotePad to write a book versus using a word processor like Microsoft Word. You could do it, but it wouldn't look as good and it would be much harder without things like spell-checking and formatting. In a similar way, you can use R without R Studio but we wouldn't recommend it. The key thing to remember is that although you will do all of your work using R Studio for this course, you are actually using two pieces of software which means that from time-to-time, both of them may have separate updates.

All of the University of Glasgow computers should already have R and R Studio installed, however, both are freely available so you may wish to install them on your own machine.

### Getting to know R Studio

R Studio has a console that you can try out code in (appearing as the bottom left window in Figure \@ref(fig:img-rstudio)), there is a script editor (top left), a window showing functions and objects you have created in the “Environment” tab (top right window in the figure), and a window that shows plots, files packages, and help documentation (bottom right).

<img src="images/rstudio.png" alt="RStudio interface" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:img-rstudio)RStudio interface</p>
</div>

You will learn more about how to use the features included in R Studio throughout this course, however, we highly recommend watching [RStudio Essentials 1](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-part-1/) from the R Studio team. The video lasts ~30 minutes and gives a tour of the main parts of R Studio. 

## Functions and arguments

**Functions** in R execute specific tasks and normally take a number of **arguments** (if you're into linguistics you might want to think as these as verbs that require a subject and an object). You can look up all the arguments that a function takes by using the help documentation by using the format `?function`. Some arguments are required, and some are optional. Optional arguments will often use a default (normally specified in the help documentation) if you do not enter any value.

As an example, let’s look at the help documentation for the function `rnorm()` which randomly generates a set of numbers with a normal distribution. 

Open up R Studio and in the console, type the following code:


```r
?rnorm
```

The help documentation for `rnorm()` should appear in the bottom right help panel. In the usage section, we see that `rnorm()` takes the following form:


```r
rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

In the arguments section, there are explanations for each of the arguments. `n` is the number of observations we want to create, `mean` is the mean of the data points we will create and `sd` is the standard deviation of the set. In the details section it notes that if no values are entered for `mean` and `sd` it will use a default of 0 and 1 for these values. Because there is no default value for `n` it must be specified otherwise the code won't run.

Let's try an example and just change the required argument `n` to ask R to produce 5 random numbers. Copy and paste the following code into the console.


```r
set.seed(12042016)
rnorm(n = 5)
```

```
## [1] -0.2896163 -0.6428964  0.5829221 -0.3286728 -0.5110101
```

These numbers have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1. Now we can change the additional arguments to produce a different set of numbers.


```r
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 10, sd = 2)
```

```
## [1] 13.320853  9.377956 10.235461  9.811793 13.019102
```

This time R has still produced 5 random numbers, but now this set of numbers has a mean of 10 and an sd of 2 as specified. Always remember to use the help documentation to help you understand what arguments a function requires.


<div class="info">
<p>If you’re looking up examples of code online, you may often see code that starts with the function <code>set.seed()</code>. This function controls the random number generator - if you’re using any functions that generate numbers randomly (such as <code>rnorm()</code>), running <code>set.seed()</code> will ensure that you get the same result (in some cases this may not be what you want to do). We call <code>set.seed()</code> in this example because it means that you will get the same random numbers as this book.</p>
</div>

### Argument names

In the above examples, we have written out the argument names in our code (e.g., `n`, `mean`, `sd`), however, this is not strictly necessary. The following two lines of code will both produce the same result:


```r
rnorm(n = 6, mean = 3, sd = 1)
rnorm(6, 3, 1)
```

Importantly, if you do not write out the argument names, R will use the default order of arguments, that is for `rnorm` it will assume that the first number you enter is `n`. the second number is `mean` and the third number is `sd`. 

If you write out the argument names then you can write the arguments in whatever order you like:


```r
rnorm(sd = 1, n = 6, mean = 3)
```

When you are first learning R, you may find it useful to write out the argument names as it can help you remember and understand what each part of the function is doing. However, as your skills progress you may find it quicker to omit the argument names and you will also see examples of code online that do not use argument names so it is important to be able to understand which argument each bit of code is referring to (or look up the help documentation to check).

In this course, we will always write out the argument names the first time we use each function, however, in subsequent uses they may be omitted.

### Tab auto-complete

One very useful feature of R Studio is the tab auto-complete for functions (see Figure \@ref(fig:img-autocomplete). If you write the name of the function and then press the tab key, R Studio will show you the arguments that function takes along with a brief description. If you press enter on the argument name it will fill in the name for you, just like auto-complete on your phone. This is incredibly useful when you are first learning R and you should remember to use this feature frequently. 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/autocomplete.png" alt="Tab auto-complete" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:img-autocomplete)Tab auto-complete</p>
</div>

## Base R and packages

When you install R you will have access to a range of functions including options for data wrangling and statistical analysis. The functions that are included in the default installation are typically referred to as **Base R** and there is a useful cheat sheet that shows many Base R functions [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf).

However, the power of R is that it is extendable and open source - put simply, if a function doesn't exist or doesn't work very well, anyone can create a new **package** that contains data and code to allow you to perform new tasks. You may find it useful to think of Base R as the default apps that come on your phone and packages as additional apps that you need to download separately.

### Installing and loading packages

In order to use a package, you must first install it. The following code installs the package `tidyverse`, a package we will use very frequently in this course.


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You only need to install a package once, however, each time you start R you need to load the packages you want to use, in a similar way that you need to install an app on your phone once, but you need to open it every time you want to use it.

To load packages we use the function `library()`. Typically you would start any analysis script by loading all of the packages you need, but we will come back to that in Lab 1.


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

Now that we've loaded the `tidyverse` package we can use any of the functions it contains but remember, you need to run the `library()` function every time you start R.

<div class="info">
<p>All of the University of Glasgow computers will already have all of the packages you need for this course so you only need to install packages if you are using your own machine. Please do not install any new packages on the university machines.</p>
</div>

### Package updates

In addition to updates to R and R Studio, the creators of packages also sometimes update their code. This can be to add functions to a package, or it can be to fix errors. One thing to avoid is unintentionally updating an installed package. When you run `install.packages()` it will always install the latest version of the package and it will overwrite any older versions you may have installed. Sometimes this isn't a problem, however, sometimes you will find that the update means your code no longer works as the package has changed substantially. It is possible to revert back to an older version of a package but try to avoid this anyway.

<div class="danger">
<p>To avoid accidentally overwriting a package with a later version, you should <strong>never</strong> include <code>install.packages()</code> in your analysis scripts in case you, or someone else runs the code by mistake. Remember, the University of Glasgow computers will already have all of the packages you need for this course so you only need to install packages if you are using your own machine.</p>
</div>

### Package conflicts

There are thousands of different R packages with even more functions. Unfortunately, sometimes different packages have the same function names. For example, the packages `dplyr` and `MASS` both have a function named `select()`. If you load both of these packages, R will produce a warning telling you that there is a conflict.


```r
library(dplyr)
library(MASS)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'MASS'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
## 
##     select
```

In this case, R is telling you that the function `select()` in the `dplyr` is being hidden (or 'masked') by another function with the same name. If you were to try and use `select()`, R would use the function from the package that was loaded most recently - in this case it would use the function from `MASS`.

If you want to specify which package you want to use for a particular function you can use code in the format `package::function`, for example:


```r
dplyr::select(...)
MASS::select(...)
```

## Objects

A large part of your coding will involve creating and manipulating objects. Objects contain stuff. That stuff can be numbers, words, or the result of operations and analyses.You assign content to an object using `<-`.

Copy and paste the following code into the console and run it. You should see that `name`, `age`, `today`, `new_year`, and `data` appear in the environment pane.


```r
name <- "emily"
age <- 15 + 18 
today <-Sys.Date()
new_year <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
data <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 15, sd = 3)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/objects-enviro.png" alt="Objects in the environment" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:img-objects-enviro)Objects in the environment</p>
</div>

Note that in these examples, `name`,`age`, and `new_year` would always contain the values `emily`, `33`, and the date of New Year's Day 2020, however, `today` will draw the date from the operating system and `data` will be a randomly generated set of data so the values of these objects will not be static.

Importantly, objects can be involved in calculations and can interact with each other. For example:


```r
age + 10
new_year - today
mean(data)
```

```
## [1] 43
## Time difference of 178 days
## [1] 17.66644
```

Finally, you can store the result of these operations in a new object:


```r
decade <- age + 10
```

<div class="try">
<p>You may find it helpful to read <code>&lt;-</code> as <code>contains</code>, e.g., <code>name</code> contains the text <code>emily</code>.</p>
</div>

You will constantly be creating objects throughout this course and you will learn more about them and how they behave as we go along, however, for now it is enough to understand that they are a way of saving values, that these values can numbers, text, or the result of operations, and that they can be used in further operations to create new variables.

<div class="info">
<p>You may also see objects referred to as ‘variables’. There is a difference between the two in programming terms, however, they are used synonomously very frequently.</p>
</div>

Getting good at programming really means getting good trying stuff out,  searching for help online, and finding examples of code to copy. If you are having difficulty with any of the exercises contained in this book then you can ask for help on Slack or Moodle, however, learning to problem-solve effectively is a key skill that you need to develop throughout this course. 

* Use the help documentation. If you're struggling to understand how a function works, remember the `?function` command.
* If you get an error message, copy and paste it in to Google - it's very likely someone else has had the same problem.
* In addition to these course materials there are a number of excellent resources for learning R:
  * [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
  * [StackOverlow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
  * Search or use the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23rstats&src=typd) hashtag on Twitter

If you would like to push yourself further with R, we reccomend working through [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) in full and/or the materials for the [MSc Data Skills course](https://gupsych.github.io/data_skills/) run by Prof. Lisa DeBruine and Dr. Dale Barr at the University of Glasgow.

## Debugging tips

A large part of coding is trying to figure why your code doesn't work and this is true whether you are a novice or an expert. As you progress through this course  you should keep a record of mistakes you make and how you fixed them. In each chapter we will provide a number of common mistakes to look out for but you will undoubtedly make (and fix!) new mistakes yourself.

* Have you loaded the correct packages for the functions you are trying to use? One very common mistake is to write the code to load the package, e.g., `library(tidyverse)` but then forget to run it.
* Have you made a typo? Remember `data` is not the same as `DATA` and `t.test` is not the same as `t_test`.
* Is there a package conflict? Have you tried specifying the package and function with `package::function`?
* Is it definitely an error? Not all red text in R means an error - sometimes it is just giving you a message with information. 

## Test yourself

**Question 1.** Why should you never include the code `install.packages()` in your analysis scripts? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["You (or someone else) may accidentally install a package update that stops your code working"]'> <option></option> <option>You should use library() instead</option> <option>Packages are already part of Base R</option> <option>You (or someone else) may accidentally install a package update that stops your code working</option> <option>You already have the latest version of the package</option></select> 



<div class='solution'><button>Explain This Answer</button>

Remember, when you run `install.packages()` it will always install the latest version of the package and it will overwrite any older versions of the package you may have installed.

</div>
 
<br>
**Question 2.**What will the following code produce?
  

```r
rnorm(6, 50, 10)
```

<select class='solveme' data-answer='["A dataset with 6 numbers that has a mean of 50 and an SD of 10"]'> <option></option> <option>A dataset with 10 numbers that has a mean of 6 and an SD of 50</option> <option>A dataset with 6 numbers that has a mean of 50 and an SD of 10</option> <option>A dataset with 50 numbers that has a mean of 10 and an SD of 6</option> <option>A dataset with 50 numbers that has a mean of 10 and an SD of 6</option></select>  


<div class='solution'><button>Explain This Answer</button>

The default form for `rnorm()` is `rnorm(n, mean, sd)`. If you need help remembering what each argument of a function does, look up the help documentation by running `?rnorm`

</div>
  
<br>
**Question 3.** If you have two packages that have functions with the same name and you want to specify exactly which package to use, what code would you use? 

<select class='solveme' data-answer='["package::function"]'> <option></option> <option>package::function</option> <option>function::package</option> <option>library(package)</option> <option>install.packages(package)</option></select>  


<div class='solution'><button>Explain This Answer</button>

You should use the form `package::function`, for example `dplyr::select`. Remember that when you first load your packages R will warn you if any functions have the same name - remember to look out for this!
